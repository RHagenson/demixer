/*
Package ami computes the Average Mututal Information (AMI) Profile for a given
sequence. There will also eventually be utilities to compute the similarity
between two AMI Profiles via one minus the correlation coefficient and compute
a matrix of similarities when given a collection of AMI Profiles. There
should also be a utility that accepts AMI Profiles on a channel and computes
similarities as Profiles are generated.
